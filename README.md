# Predict Future Sales
The competition on Kaggle:  Data Science predict future sales

For this project, I use Google Colab, connect with my Google Drive, get the file kaggle.json I saved in my drive to download the dataset of the competition of Kaggle. This is the link of this competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales. You can download the dataset from here.

In this kernel, I do some below tasks:
- Explorating the dataset
- Visualizing some information
- Preprocessing the data for training
- Fine-tuning the XGBoost model for the best prediction

You can read the notebook for more understanding what I did.
